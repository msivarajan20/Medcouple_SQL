# Medcouple derivation for a distribution(Entity column in this code) using SQL

### Project Overview
The medcouple is a robust statistic that measures the skewness of a univariate distribution. It is defined as a scaled median difference of the left and right half of a distribution. Its robustness makes it suitable for identifying outliers in adjusted boxplots.

Ordinary box plots do not fare well with skew distributions, since they label the longer unsymmetrical tails as outliers. Using the medcouple, the whiskers of a boxplot can be adjusted for skew distributions and thus have a more accurate identification of outliers for non-symmetrical distributions.
